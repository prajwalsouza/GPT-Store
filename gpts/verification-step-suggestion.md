#Verification Step Suggestion for GPT Store

To improve the reliability and ensure the authenticity of GPTs added to the GPT Store, the following verification step should be implemented:

- **Verify the domain**: Check if the link provided is from an OpenAI domain. This includes domains like `openai.com` or related official domains.
- **Link Examination* : If the domain is correct, attempt to access the link to verify its functionality and relevance. This would involve ensuring that the link leads to a geuine GPT-related page.
- **Proceed with Addition** : Only after verifying that the link is from an OpenAI related domain and leads to a relevant gpt, continue with adding the gpt to the store.
- **Inform the User** : If the link does not meet these criteria, request a different link or inform the user of the issue.

These steps will help maintain the integrity and reliability of the GPT Store, ensuring that only genuine and functional GPTs are added.
